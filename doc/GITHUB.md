It seems like there might be an issue with the way Git is configured or the command used to change the remote URL.
Let's make sure to update the remote URL correctly:

To update the remote URL for your local repository, follow these steps:

1. **Check Current Remote URLs:**
   Confirm the current remote URL(s) associated with your repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Change the Remote URL:**
   Update the remote URL using the `git remote set-url` command with the correct GitHub repository URL for your empty repository:

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jookie/convex-chatgpt.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

3. **Verify Remote URL Update:**
   Verify that the remote URL has been updated by checking the remote URL again:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

After ensuring that the remote URL has been updated correctly, try to push your changes again:

```bash
git push origin master  # Or the branch name you are pushing
```

Make sure to replace `master` with the appropriate branch name if you're working on a different branch.
